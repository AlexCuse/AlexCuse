### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I find myself working primarily in go these days.

Some of my favorite current projects on here include the [EdgeXFoundry](https://github.com/EdgeXFoundry) and [watermill](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill) ecosystems.  I can often be found working there or on [authn-server](https://github.com/keratin/authn-server).

I used to maintain the [SquishIt](https://nuget.org/packages/SquishIt) package for ASP.net content delivery optimization.  If you are still using it in a legacy application and having issues please get in touch [here](https://github.com/AlexCuse/SquishIt/issues).
